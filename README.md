 ## About
This is my portfolio page for full stack web development.
There is a photo of my son and I at the beach and a brief bio of me.
The links in the navigation bar jump to the corresponding sections on the main page.
There is a section of photos that link to my deployed projects(in progress-just placeholders for now).
There is a contact section with links to my LinkedIn and Github.
This is a work-in-progress that i will be updating periodically.
This page is just HTML and CSS currently, but will be adding javascript soon!
